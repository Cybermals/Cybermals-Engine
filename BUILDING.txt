Notes
=====
* There is a deps.zip file in the project root that contains a prebuilt version of all
the dependencies required by the Cybermals Engine. You can unzip it directly into
the project root and skip steps 4 and 5 of the build process to save time.


Windows
=======
1. install MinGW-w64 or Visual Studio
2. install CMake
3. download or clone this repo
4. download the dependencies:
    * SDL2
    * SDL2_image
    * SDL2_mixer
    * SDL2_ttf
    * SDL2_net
    * libexpat
    * sqlite3
5. build the dependencies and install them into "deps/{platform}/{arch}/{dep}" where
{platform} is the OS name (ex. windows), {arch} is the architecture (ex. i386), and
{dep} is the dependency name (ex. SDL2)
6. start CMake and set the source dir to the folder containing this file and set the
build dir to a folder where you want to build this project 
(ex. Cybermals-Engine-mingw)
7. click "Configure"
8. choose "MinGW Makefiles" if you are using MinGW-w64 or the version of 
Visual Studio you have installed
8. adjust the build options as you see fit; be sure to set the install prefix to
the folder where you want to install the project
9. click "Configure" again
10. click "Generate"
11. if you are using MinGW-w64 open a command prompt, navigate to the build dir,
and run "mingw32-make install"
12. if you are using Visual Studio, simply open the solution file in the build dir
and build it


Linux
=====
1. install GCC via your package manager (ex. "sudo apt-get install build-essential")

5. build the dependencies and install them into "deps/{platform}/{arch}/{dep}" where
{platform} is the OS name (ex. linux), {arch} is the architecture (ex. amd64), and
{dep} is the dependency name (ex. SDL2)
6. open a terminal to the folder where you cloned this repo
7. run "cmake -S Cybermals-Engine -B Cybermals-Engine-build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX={install_prefix} -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release"
where {install_prefix} is the folder where you want to install the project 
(ex. $HOME/Cybermals-Engine)
